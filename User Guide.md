# Foreword
The manual has been tested using the NTSC-U version of the game. I have made an effort to make names of certain items apply to NTSC-U and PAL versions of the game, although if you're a PAL player you may need to do some more tweaking on your own. I can't guarantee the manual's compatibility with NTSC-J version of the game.

Gran Turismo Manual's general progression assumes you'll be starting the game from a fresh save file. Depending on settings though you may want to prepare your save file (either via cheats or revisiting a finished playthrough) to make Manual experience as smooth as possible:
| Option | Preparation |
| --- | --- |
| Enabled "License Tests" locations | Obtain every license available |
| Enabled "Arcade Mode" locations | Win every race in Arcade mode |
| Disabled "Limit Starter Cars" option | Have ~5 million credits |

# Rules of the game
Each event is a location. Obtain licenses to unlock more events. Obtain permits to be able to use more cars in said events. Obtain upgrades to apply on cars to make them stronger and win events more easily.

The goal is winning the final GT League championship (GT World Cup) residing in Simulation Mode's Go Race tab.

# Items
## Progressive License (progression)
Unlocks events in Simulation Mode. The number of obtained license items applies to the following:
| Count | License |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | No license |
| 1 | B-Class license |
| 2 | A-Class license |
| 3 | iA-Class license |

## Trophy (progression)
MacGuffins of this .apworld. Can be enabled using .yaml options. Once enabled, the goal will additionally require collecting a certain number of trophies. The number of available and required trophies can be adjusted.

## Milestone (progression)
Dummy items marking important milestones of GT League progressions. Pre-placed in "Win Sunday Cup", "Win Clubman Cup" and "Win GT Cup" locations. You need to obtain every milestone in order to access GT World Cup and reach the goal.

## Manufacturer permits (progression)
Gran Turismo does not allow the use of cars obtained through Simulation Mode in Arcade Mode races. Because of that permits have been separated between Simulation and Arcade variants.
### Simulation
You start the run with a random Simulation permit. Each car manufacturer available in-game has its own permit. By getting a permit you obtain permission to use said manufacturer's cars in Simulation Mode events. For example, if you get a Toyota Permit, you'll be able to use Toyota cars in your run.
### Arcade
Each manufacturer permit available in Arcade Mode has been further divided into three classes: A-Class, B-Class and C-Class. By getting a permit you obtain permission to use said manufacturer's cars of a given class in Arcade Mode events. For example, if you get a Mazda C-Class Permit, you'll be able to use Mazda cars in C-Class races.

## Upgrades
Unlocks an upgrade, allowing you to purchase them for your cars. Some upgrades may not be available in certain cars. If a car comes with upgrades already installed, you may use them on that car even if you didn't unlock them yet.

# Locations
## Simulation Mode
### GT League
The most important events are hosted there. Win all championships available there to win the game.
### Spot Race
Beginner friendly races that are available from the start.
### Special Events
A variety of races focused on different types of cars. Each event requires a car with specific drivetrain, country of origin or without specific upgrades.
### Endurance
Extremely long races, each one taking 1-2 hours to finish. Tire durability is enabled in these events.
### License Tests
Short time trials meant to test and improve your driving skills.
### Time Trial
Set a best lap time on tracks. Reversed variants of tracks can also be enabled.
### Qualifiers
Each championship's race has qualifiers. During qualifiers you have one shot at setting a lap time. Pole Position means finishing qualifiers on 1st place.
## Arcade Mode
A single race against opponents. Driving is simplified and tracks feature jumps in certain sections. Difficulty can be adjusted to your liking.

# Options
## Trophy Hunt
Adds Trophies to the item pool. Makes the goal additionally require collecting a specified amount of trophies.
## Trophy Total
Set the total amount of trophies to be added to the item pool. Applies only if Trophy Hunt is enabled.
## Trophy Required
Set the required amount of trophies to be collected to reach goal. Applies only if Trophy Hunt is enabled.
## Limit Started Cars
Set whether you want to limit manufacturer permits you want to receive as your starting item to those with cars costing under 10,000 credits.
## Simulation Head Start
Adds a small bundle of upgrades to starting items to make early game a bit easier.
## Progressive Tires
Makes Tires progressive instead of being individual item for every type.
## License Tests
Adds license tests to the location pool. Slightly slows down the seed.
## Endurance Events
Adds endurances to the location pool. Extremely slow.
## Qualifiers
Adds qualifiers to the location pool. Extremely slow.
## Time Trials
Adds time trials to the location pool. Makes initial location pool much bigger.
## Arcade Mode
Adds Arcade Mode to the location pool. Slightly slows down the seed.
## Arcade Head Start
Adds one track and manufacturer permit to make at least one Arcade Mode location accessible from the start.
## Death Link
When you die, everyone who enabled death link die. Of course, the reverse is true too. Game doesn't have a restart button, so only viable for emulators. Examples of possible death link scenarios:
- Failing and restarting a license test
- Finishing a race or qualifier below a certain position
- Going into pit lanes and changing tires

# Tips and tricks
- If you don't know which manufacturer a car belongs to, try selling it. Selling price will be slightly higher in manufacturer shop that matches your car.
- Increasing horsepower isn't the only way to make cars faster. Reducing weight, putting better tires, improving drivetrain and other upgrades are just as good for your car's performance.
- Manufacturer permits are divided into categories. There are separate categories for drivetrain, engine aspiration and even whether they have cars eligible for lightweight events. Use them to quickly filter through your permits and find what you can use.
- If a location doesn't say "win" you might as well finish on last place. Of course, you can self-impose limitations to that anyway.
- Once you win a championship you can tick off every check belonging to that championship.
- Race modified cars you can win from events or buy directly from shops are perfect for getting stuff out of logic.
- Default .yaml template is configured with settings recommended for a casual full playthrough of the game.
- Be mindful when adding locations to your run. If you enable multiple additional location options, I strongly recommend enabling Trophy Hunt and adding some trophies to the item pool. This will reduce the amount of junk items generated by this game.
